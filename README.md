# Salesforce Marketing Cloud - Autogenerated SDK

## Overview

The Salesforce Marketing Cloud Java SDK enables developers to easily access the Salesforce Marketing Cloud.

- This is an upgraded version of the existing community supported [Fuel-Java](https://github.com/salesforce-marketingcloud/FuelSDK-Java) SDK
- Unlike the [Fuel-Java](https://github.com/salesforce-marketingcloud/FuelSDK-Java), this SDK is auto generated using [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen)

## Supported Features

- [Transactional Messaging](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.mc-apis.meta/mc-apis/transactional-messaging-api.htm)

## Environment Requirements

- Java 1.8+

## Download

The easiest way to install the [Salesforce Marketing Cloud SDK](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.github.salesforce-marketingcloud/java-sdk/1.0.0/jar) is via Maven - simply add the following dependency to your project's ```pom.xml```:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.salesforce-marketingcloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>java-sdk</artifactId>

## Getting Started

### Usage scenarios
#### 1.Basic usage

Please *note* that the configuration in this scenario is taken from the environment variables.
```

Client client = new Client();
AssetApi assetApi = client.getAssetApi();
Asset asset = createAsset();   // your own implementation to get an Asset instance

Asset result = assetApi.createAsset(asset);

System.out.println(result);

```

*Environment variables:*
* SFMC_ACCOUNT_ID
* SFMC_AUTH_BASE_URL  (Authentication TSE)
* SFMC_CLIENT_ID
* SFMC_CLIENT_SECRET
* SFMC_COUNTRY_CODE   (eg: US)
* SFMC_KEYWORD        (SMS keyword)
* SFMC_SHORT_CODE     (SMS short code)

#### 2.Setting the configuration using the Client class constructor parameters
```

Client client = new Client(
    "<AUTH_BASE_URL>",
    "<CLIENT_ID>",
    "<CLIENT_SECRET>",
    "<ACCOUNT_ID>",
    "<APPLICATION_DATA-ACCESS_PERMISSIONS>"
);

AssetApi assetApi = client.getAssetApi();
Asset asset = createAsset();   // your own implementation to get an Asset instance

Asset result = assetApi.createAsset(asset);

System.out.println(result);

```
